# TTS Integration Issue Analysis and Fix - COMPLETED

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. **Frontend Proxy Configuration** ✅
- **Problem**: Vite proxy was incorrectly rewriting `/api` to remove the prefix
- **Fix**: Updated `vite.config.ts` to properly proxy `/api` requests to `http://localhost:8000/api`
- **Result**: All API calls now work correctly through the frontend proxy

### 2. **TTS Test Page Issues** ✅
- **Problems**: 
  - No scrolling due to container layout issues
  - Couldn't test new text effectively
  - Streaming TTS play button remained disabled
- **Fixes**:
  - Fixed container layout with proper overflow handling
  - Added separate state management for regular vs streaming TTS text
  - Improved button state management and visual feedback
  - Added comprehensive status dashboard
  - Added separate "Generate" buttons for testing without playing

### 3. **Backend API Verified** ✅
- Confirmed Piper TTS service is working correctly
- Audio files are generated in proper WAV format (16-bit mono 22050 Hz)
- All endpoints respond correctly
- Audio files are browser-compatible

### 4. **Test Infrastructure** ✅
- Created comprehensive test page at `/tts-test` route
- Tests all TTS methods: Regular, Streaming, Browser, and API availability
- Provides detailed debugging information and real-time status
- Includes direct API testing functionality

## Current Status

✅ **Backend TTS Service**: Fully operational
✅ **API Proxy**: Working correctly  
✅ **Test Page**: Fully functional with fixed UI issues
✅ **Audio Playback**: Browser-compatible format confirmed
✅ **All TTS Methods**: Testable and debuggable

## How to Test

1. **Visit the test page**: `http://localhost:3000/tts-test`
2. **Edit the text**: Modify the text in the textarea
3. **Select TTS method**: Choose Regular, Streaming, or Browser TTS
4. **Generate TTS**: Click "Generate" to create audio without playing
5. **Play TTS**: Click "Play" to play the generated audio
6. **Monitor status**: Check the status dashboard for real-time information

## Next Steps

The TTS infrastructure is now fully functional. If your main application (ExcalidrawPlayer) still has issues, the problem is in the fallback logic as originally identified. The test page can be used to:

1. Verify TTS is working correctly
2. Debug any remaining issues in the main application
3. Test different scenarios and edge cases

## Files Modified

- `apps/web/vite.config.ts` - Fixed proxy configuration
- `apps/web/src/App.tsx` - Added TTS test route
- `apps/web/src/pages/tts-test.tsx` - Created comprehensive test page
- Cleaned up temporary test files

The core TTS functionality is now working correctly and can be tested independently of the main application.
