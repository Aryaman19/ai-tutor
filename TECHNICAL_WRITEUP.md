Our system implements a sophisticated microservices architecture designed for scalability and maintainability:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   React Frontend │◄──►│  FastAPI Backend │◄──►│   MongoDB       │
│   (Port 3000)   │    │   (Port 8000)   │    │   (Port 27017)  │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
         │                       │                       │
         └───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┘
                                 ▼
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │   Ollama + Gemma3n  │
                    │   (Port 11434)      │
                    └─────────────────────┘
```
