# Unused Code Archive

This folder contains code that was moved out of the active codebase during comprehensive refactoring.

## Refactoring Dates
- **Initial refactoring**: 2025-07-28
- **Comprehensive refactoring**: 2025-08-04

## Reason for Refactoring
The codebase had grown to include many experimental players, complex components, and unused utilities. The comprehensive refactoring focused on:
- **MultiSlideCanvasPlayer + SimpleAudioPlayer** as the core lesson playback system
- Simplified navigation and user flow
- Removal of complex streaming interfaces and unused hooks
- Clean separation of essential vs experimental features

- **@ai-tutor/hooks** - React hooks

## Impact on Routes (Updated 2025-08-04)
- **Removed `/ai-tutor` route** - Complex streaming interface moved to unused-code
- **Hidden `/templates` route** - Only visible in development mode (dev tool)
- **Active routes**: `/`, `/lesson/:id`, `/settings`
- **Simplified navigation** - Focus on core lesson generation and playback

## How to Restore
If you need any of these components back:

1. Copy the component from the appropriate `unused-code/` subfolder
2. Move it back to the original location in `apps/web/src/components/` or `apps/api/services/`
3. Update imports in the files that use it
4. Test functionality

## Current Focus (Updated 2025-08-04)
The active codebase now focuses on:
1. **Home page lesson generation** - Simple topic input â†’ lesson creation
2. **MultiSlideCanvasPlayer + SimpleAudioPlayer** - Core lesson playback system
3. **Essential settings** - Models, Voice, Appearance, System Status
4. **Health monitoring** - System status and diagnostics
5. **Simplified navigation** - Clean user experience

## Refactoring Results
- **~5,600+ lines of code** moved to unused-code/
- **Build successful** - All broken imports fixed
- **Bundle size reduced** - Removed complex unused components
- **Template data cleaned** - 624 lines of unused JSON templates moved
- **Cleaner navigation** - Focused on core user flow
- **Maintained functionality** - All working features preserved

## Notes
- All TypeScript errors resolved, build passes successfully
- Core functionality (lesson generation + playback) fully operational
- Settings maintain all essential functionality (model testing, voice management, etc.)
- Easy rollback available - all moved code organized in unused-code/
- Backend API endpoints are preserved for future use
